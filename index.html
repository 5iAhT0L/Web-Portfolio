      <p>Hi Everyone!
        My name is Athallah Zahwan Andhika, and I am currently a 10th-grade student at Developer Indonesia Kodein Vocational School (SMK).
        I was born in Bekasi, a vibrant city that has shaped many of my early experiences.</p>
        <p>
        I have a strong passion for technology and coding, which is why I joined the Programming Club at my school. Here, I am learning new skills, solving problems, and working on exciting projects.</p>
        <p>
        I believe that programming is not just about writing code, but also about creating innovative solutions to make life better. My goal is to grow as a developer and contribute to the tech industry with meaningful ideas and projects.</p>
